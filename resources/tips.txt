German might seem tricky, but there are also a lot of similarities with English.
Welcome to the German course and let's get started!

In English, we say I am but you are. In German, you do the same thing!
ich bin - I am
du bist - you are
er/sie/es ist - he/she/it is

In German, all nouns are either masculine, feminine, or neuter. It's just a way to sort nouns!
masculine - ein Mann
feminine - eine Frau
neuter - ein Kind
